## Policy

### Technology Equipment Disposal

- When Technology assets have reached the end of their useful life they should be sent to the Systems Manager for proper disposal.
- The Systems Manager will securely erase all storage mediums in accordance with current industry best practices.
- All data including, all files and licensed software shall be removed from equipment using disk sanitising software that cleans the media overwriting each and every disk sector of the machine with zero-filled blocks, meeting Ministry of Defence standards.
- No computer or technology equipment may be sold to any individual other than through the processes identified in this policy (Employee Purchase of Disposed Equipment, see section below).
- No computer equipment should be disposed of via skips, dumps, landfill etc.  Electronic recycling bins may be periodically placed in locations around Infinity Works Consulting.  These can be used to dispose of equipment.  The Systems Manager will properly remove all data prior to final disposal.
- All electronic drives must be degaussed or overwritten with a commercially available disk cleaning program. Hard drives may also be removed and rendered unreadable (drilling, crushing or other demolition methods).
- Computer Equipment refers to desktop, laptop, tablet or netbook computers, printers, copiers, monitors, servers, handheld devices, telephones, cell phones, disc drives or any storage device, network switches, routers, wireless access points, batteries, backup tapes, etc.
- The Systems Manager will place a sticker on the equipment case indicating the disk wipe has been performed. The sticker will include the date and the initials of the technician who performed the disk wipe.
- Technology equipment with non-functioning memory or storage technology will have the memory or storage device removed and it will be physically destroyed.

### Employee Purchase of Disposed Equipment

- Equipment which is working, but reached the end of its useful life to Infinity Works Consulting, will have its memory cleared/deleted and then made available for purchase by employees.
- Employees leaving Infinity Works Consulting employment will be offered the opportunity of purchasing their work equipment, this includes their company laptop and working from home equipment (e.g. monitor).
- Any employee who's laptop has reached the end of its useful life and is replaced, will have the opportunity to purchase their laptop.
- For all other equipment purchases, a waiting list system will be used to determine who has the opportunity to purchase available equipment. When equipment is deemed available, it will first be offered to the employee at the top of this list, before moving to the next person on the list and so on. An employee choosing to buy a piece of equipment will then be removed from the waiting list, however they can then be re-added to the bottom of the waiting list again. An employee who declines on the purchase of a piece of equipment will remain on the waiting list. This ensures that all employees have a chance of obtaining equipment.
- Employees can request to be added to the disposal equipment waiting list at any time, by contacting the IT Systems Team.
- The IT Systems Team will manage the disposal equipment waiting list system.
- All purchases are final.  No warranty or support will be provided with any equipment sold.  
- Any equipment not in working order or remaining from the waiting list process will be donated or disposed of according to current environmental guidelines (following deletion of its memory).
- The IT Systems Team will grade the condition of each asset, the quality grading will account for any damages or performance issues.
- Taking the asset grading into account, the Finance team will determine an appropriate cost for each item.
- Where data is held on the equipment, the IT Systems Team will ensure the asset has a full system restore and is clear of any Infinity Works Consulting data or links to data.
- The purchaser will ensure that the reset has been completed and that all Infinity Works Consulting data and links to data have been removed.
- Infinity Works Consulting will ensure that contracts are in place to donate or properly dispose of outdated technology assets.
