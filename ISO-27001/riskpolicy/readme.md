# Risk Management Policy

## Definition

This policy sets out to define the framework the risk management process at Infinity Works should adhere to.

## Overview

Infinity Works recognises that risk management is an integral part of both sound management practice and good corporate governance as it improves decision making, enhances outcomes and strengthens management accountability. The Company’s objectives, its internal organisation and the environment in which it operates are continually evolving and as a result the risks it faces are continually changing. A sound system of internal control therefore depends on a thorough and regular evaluation of the nature and extent of the risks to which the Company is exposed.

## Policy

The Company operates a risk register which identifies the potential risks to the Infinity Works business and our clients alongside details steps taken to mitigate or control those risks. The risk register is reviewed regularly and updated as new risks are identified and/or new controls put in place. The [Management Team/Operations Directors] meet to review the register every quarter and the [Executive Board] review the relevance of the register on at least an annual basis by assessing the effectiveness of the documented controls against the known risks.

## Key Documents

- Systems Risk Register - A working document used to track low level detailed tasks as and when appropriate. Any significant risks identified here are escalated onto the operational risk register for visbibility of the full ISMS comittee and so that they are managed in accordance with the policy.
- Operational Risk Register - A register visible to the wider ISMS and managed in-line with the above policy.
